Project name: 
Game Tradehub – A Marketplace for RPG Game Items

it is essentially a dynamic online marketplace where players of a generic RPG game can buy and sell in-game items. 
It allows users to view, purchase, and make offers on various virtual game items. Players can browse through a list of available items, each with detailed descriptions, and choose to make an offer to bid for these items using in-game currency.
The site also includes a profile page where users can view their own offers and interactions with the marketplace.

Design Process:
The website is designed with players in mind, providing them with an intuitive platform to trade in-game items, view detailed information about the items, and make offers.
The goal was to create a user-friendly interface that allows players to easily find and buy the items they want. 
The primary users of the platform are  enthusiasts looking for an easier way to enhance their in-game experiences by acquiring new items or selling ones they no longer need.

As a user, I want to search for items so that I can easily find the equipment I want to purchase.
As a user, I want to view detailed information about each item so that I can make an informed decision about whether to buy it.
As a user, I want to make offers for items I am interested in so that I can negotiate the price.
As a user, I want to view my profile and see my active offers so that I can manage my transactions and offers.

Features:
Marketplace Section:
The main page features a marketplace where users can browse available items, such as weapons and shields. Each item has a "Buy" button and links to its detailed page, where users can learn more about the item and make an offer.
Example: Golden Sword, Obsidian Shield, Shark Gun, etc.

Search Functionality:
A search bar allows users to filter items by name, making it easier to find specific items in the marketplace.

Item Detail Pages:
Each item has its own detail page (e.g., Golden Sword page), showcasing information such as its power, range, and description. Users can also make an offer directly from the item’s page.

Profile Page:
Users can view their profile with a username and the list of offers they've made. This section also tracks user transactions within the marketplace.

Offer Submission:
Users can submit offers on items they wish to purchase. This allows negotiation within the marketplace.

Features Left to Implement:
User Logins:
Implementing user registration and login systems to allow users to securely manage their profile and transactions.

Making own offers:
Implmenting the ability for users to put their items up for bid
Not sure if i should make it so it reads user data to display their inventory
or make it so it displays "everything" so they can just choose what they wish to bid

Technologies Used:
HTML:
The project utilizes HTML to structure the content on the web pages, such as the marketplace, item details, and user profiles.

CSS:
The project uses CSS for styling the webpage, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive layout. The design is structured using CSS Flexbox and Grid for responsive item listings and layout adjustments.

JavaScript:
JavaScript is used to handle interactions like submitting offers, dynamically updating the list of offers, and managing UI elements such as the search bar and profile sections.

JQuery:
The project uses JQuery for simplifying DOM manipulation. JQuery is particularly helpful for handling user interactions like form submissions and DOM updates, ensuring the site remains responsive and interactive.
