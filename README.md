DESIGN PROCESS
my idea for this website is that, i play a lot of games and while most MMORPGs have a trading system, most of them do not have a formatted system 
so if any player wanted to look for a specific item or sell a specific item, it usually requires them to spam in the public chat about their offers
hence i decided that i wanted to make this psuedo trading hub

FEATURES
-The search bar allows players to filter out what items they want to look for
-The trade button allows the player to send a message to the seller saying that they wish to meet them to trade

FEATURES LEFT TO IMPLEMENT
-add items from your profile to sell in the market place
-nav links
-profile

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
-Linkedin learning & youtube: i had to search up some tutorials for how to utilize javascript
